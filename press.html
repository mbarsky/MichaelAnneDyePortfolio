    <br/><p>Most Cubans have terrible access to the Internet -- estimates suggest only 5-25% of the populace can regularly get online. The government made it a bit easier in recent years with paid wifi hotspots, but they require dough, and they're super slow.</p>

    <br/><p>A handful of independent, web-based news outlets in Cuba are chipping away at the Communist-run island’s half-century state media monopoly, challenging the official version of reality. While low levels of internet access across the Caribbean island limits the outlets’ domestic reach and they are not fully free to speak their mind...</p>

    <br/><p>President Barack Obama called on the Cuban government to expand Internet access for its citizens in a speech in Havana on Tuesday. In Cuba, less than about 5 percent of the population has open Internet access. That’s slowly changing as the government adds a few Wi-Fi hotspots and foreign companies work to update the digital infrastructure.</p>

    <br/><p>After their son's suicide, one Wisconsin couple was desperate for answers. They tried to log into his e-mail and Facebook accounts but failed. The grieving parents finally got a court order to access these online records, arguing that just as their son's death gave them ownership of his tangible assets, so it also gave them rights to his digital contributions.</p>

    <br/><p>The comments and likes of an Instagram photograph become part of the viewer’s experience of that image. On this visual social network, communication is subtle, playful, innocent and devoid of any social expectations. It’s a place where image makers can go to freely express themselves and find other like-minded aesthetes. The adage says that a picture is worth a thousand words, but on Instagram that same photo is worth far more than that.</p>

    <br/><p>The 1990s Britipop band Oasis’ song “Live Forever” was written by bandmember Noel Gallagher in 1991, shortly after his foot was crushed by a pipe while working. With more time on his hands, he was able to focus on song lyrics. This is how it ends: “We’re gonna live forever / Gonna live forever / Live forever / Forever.” After he finished it, he showed it to his younger brother Liam, who was so pleased that he asked Noel to join the band Oasis.</p>
